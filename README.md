# calculator

The first more demanding project with JS, created with vanilla stack.

Not happy about the looks, but at the time I was less aware of dynamic units.

Things that could be improved:
- yet again project that was unaware of pseudoclasses (uses eventlisteners instead):
- - it's desktop only, fixed sizes, no media queries;
- the way "rounding" numbers is handled; and
- general clarity of the code.

I'm the most dissatisfied with the code's clarity.  I have made a huge mistake of not documenting of my reasoning for employment of certain devices in the project, this eventually resulted in the situation where I as the creator of the thing have trouble myself understanding the code and fixing bugs without trial-and-error brute-forcing.  For any future projects that may have a big number of all kinds of exceptions I will certainly not make a similar mistake.

Overall, the project is pretty solid, I believe I've managed everything I wanted to, in some way or another, other than proper number rounding, but I guess I just didn't put enough effort to try find some proper Math method? Regardless, I may try fixing that in the future, it's only a few lines of code that should be fairly easy to be altered.
